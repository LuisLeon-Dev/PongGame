# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle module.

## Description

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls a paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen, and they can compete against either a human opponent or a computer-controlled opponent.

## Files

1. **ball.py**: This file contains the implementation of the ball class, which manages the behavior of the ball in the game, including its movement and collisions.
   
2. **main.py**: This is the main script file that runs the Pong game. It initializes the game window, sets up the game elements, and manages the game loop.
   
3. **score_board.py**: This file handles the display and management of the score during gameplay. It keeps track of both players' scores and updates them accordingly.
   
4. **paddle.py**: Here lies the implementation of the paddle class, which controls the behavior of the paddles in the game, including their movement and collision detection.

## How to Play

1. Run `main.py` to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys or 'W' and 'S' keys to control the left paddle.
3. For the second-player, use the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to control the right paddle.
4. The game ends when one player reaches the score limit, usually set to 10 (coming soon).
5. Enjoy the game!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (comes pre-installed with most Python distributions)
